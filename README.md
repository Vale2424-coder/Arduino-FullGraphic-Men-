### Problem
I'm working on a Marlin-based Arduino firmware that compiles and runs perfectly with the **RepRapDiscount Smart Controller** (standard 20x4 text display), but I want to switch to a **RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller** (128x64 ST7920).

As soon as I change the display type in `Configuration.h`, the code fails to compile.

### My goal
I want the exact same functionality and menu layout as with the normal LCD, but on the Full Graphic Display.

### Important note
‚ö†Ô∏è I'm not experienced in programming.  
I'm using this project for school, and I'm trying to get it working with a graphical display. I don't understand all parts of the firmware, especially the custom menu rendering.

Any help or suggestions would be **very much appreciated**! üôè  
Thank you!
